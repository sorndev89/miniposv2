Role: Act as a Senior Full Stack Web Developer with 10+ years of experience in teaching. Goal: Create a project structure and code guidelines for a Point of Sale (POS) system tailored for beginners. Tech Stack:

Backend: Laravel 12 (API Mode), MySQL.

Frontend: Vue.js 3 (Composition API <script setup>), Vite.

State Management: Pinia.

Routing: Vue Router.

Key Libraries: axios (with JWT), vue-cleave-component (number formatting), vue-select (dropdowns), flatpickr (date range).

Project Requirements: The system must be clean, scalable, and easy to understand for students. Avoid over-engineering.

1. Database Schema (Simplified for Learning)
Design a relational database with these specific tables:

users: id, name, email, password, roles (admin/staff).

categories: id, name.

products: id, category_id, name, image, price (sell), cost (buy), stock_qty, barcode.

orders: id, user_id, total_amount, received_amount, change_amount, payment_status, created_at.

order_details: id, order_id, product_id, price, quantity, total.

transactions: id, product_id, type (import/sale), amount, description, created_at (Used for tracking stock movement).

2. Frontend Pages & Features Logic
Analyze and structure the Vue 3 frontend as follows:

A. Authentication

Login Page: Simple form with Email/Password. Use JWT via API. Store token in localStorage & Pinia AuthStore.

B. Product Management (CRUD)

Page: /products

Features: List products with pagination. Add/Edit Modal.

Libraries: Use vue-select for selecting Categories. Use vue-cleave-component for Price/Cost inputs (formatting currency).

C. Stock Management

Page: /stock/import

Features: A form to select a product and add quantity.

Logic: Create a transaction record (type: 'import') and increment products.stock_qty.

D. POS Page (The Core Feature)

Page: /pos

Layout:

Left: Product Grid (Image, Name, Stock, Price) with a Search Bar.

Right: Cart Section (Selected items list, Quantity adjustment, Total calculation).

State Management: Use Pinia (CartStore) to handle: addToCart, removeFromCart, increment/decrement, clearCart, and totalPrice computed property.

Checkout: A button to submit the order.

Backend Logic: Create Order, create OrderDetails, create Transaction (type: 'sale'), and decrement products.stock_qty.

E. Reports & History

Page: /reports

Features: View list of sold orders.

Libraries: Use flatpickr to filter orders by Date Range (Start Date - End Date).

3. Coding Guidelines for Teaching
Laravel: Use Resource Controllers and Form Requests for validation. Keep logic in Services or Controllers (keep it simple).

Vue: Strictly use Composition API (<script setup>).

Code Style: Clean, commented code explaining why we use specific libraries (e.g., "Why use Pinia here?").

Task: Please generate the Project Folder Structure, API Routes List (api.php), and the Pinia useCartStore code based on the requirements above.
