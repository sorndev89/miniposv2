# Installation Steps for MiniPOS2

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the MiniPOS2 project on your local machine. This project consists of a Laravel 12 backend and a Vue.js 3 frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **PHP:** Version 8.2 or higher.
*   **Composer:** For managing PHP dependencies.
*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher (includes npm).
*   **npm or Yarn:** For managing JavaScript dependencies.
*   **MySQL:** Database server.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository (If not already done)

If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd MiniPOS2
```

## Step 2: Backend Setup (Laravel)

1.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (`MiniPOS2/`) and install the Composer dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

2.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Copy the example environment file and generate an application key:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
    Open the `.env` file and configure your database connection. Replace `<your_database_name>`, `<your_database_user>`, and `<your_database_password>` with your actual MySQL credentials.

    ```dotenv
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=<your_database_name>
    DB_USERNAME=<your_database_user>
    DB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
    ```

3.  **Create Database and Run Migrations:**
    Create a new MySQL database for the project (e.g., `minipos2_db`). Then, run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

4.  **Seed the Database (Optional but recommended for development):**
    Populate the database with some initial data (users, categories, products):
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

5.  **Start the Laravel Development Server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    This will typically start the backend server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Step 3: Frontend Setup (Vue.js)

1.  **Install JavaScript Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (`MiniPOS2/`) and install the npm dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use Yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
    Also, install Flowbite for UI components:
    ```bash
    npm install flowbite
    ```
    (Flowbite is imported in `resources/js/app.js` and its `initFlowbite()` function is called in relevant components for dynamic initialization).

2.  **Build and Run the Frontend:**
    Start the Vite development server for the Vue.js frontend:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or if you use Yarn
    # yarn dev
    ```
    This will typically start the frontend server at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

### Frontend Routing
The application uses Vue Router for navigation. The main routing configuration is located at `resources/js/router/index.js`.

### Pinia Stores
The application uses Pinia for state management. Key stores include:
*   `resources/js/stores/auth.js`: Handles user authentication state, including token and user information.
*   `resources/js/stores/cart.js`: Manages the shopping cart state for the POS system.

### Main Vue Application Entry Points
The root Vue component is `resources/js/App.vue`, and the main JavaScript entry point is `resources/js/app.js`. These are served by Laravel's `resources/views/app.blade.php`.

The default Laravel welcome page (`resources/views/welcome.blade.php`) has been removed as it's not used in this SPA setup.


## Step 4: Access the Application

Once both the Laravel backend and Vue.js frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser, usually at the address provided by the `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`) command (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

You should now be able to log in using the seeded user credentials (if you ran `php artisan db:seed`). Check `database/seeders/UserSeeder.php` for default user credentials.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Permissions Issues:** If you encounter issues related to file permissions, try running:
    ```bash
    chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
    chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache # Adjust user/group if not using www-data
    ```
*   **Composer/npm/Yarn Errors:** Ensure your internet connection is stable and try clearing caches:
    ```bash
    composer clear-cache
    npm cache clean --force # or yarn cache clean
    ```
*   **Database Connection Errors:** Double-check your `.env` file for correct database credentials.
*   **Vite build errors:** Make sure `npm install` finished successfully.

That's it! You should now have the MiniPOS2 application running locally.
